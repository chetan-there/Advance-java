Program_01: Student Management System (JDBC-Based)
==================================================

You are developing a JDBC-based Java application to manage student data for a university system using a Student class and a test class.

Requirements:
--------------

Student Class:
--------------
Attributes:

.String studentId
.String studentName
.String course
.int semester
.String email
.String phoneNumber

Functional Requirements:
------------------------
➔one parameterised constructor to initialise all variables.

➔ Create a method insertStudent(Student student) that Inserts a new student into the StudentTable using PreparedStatement.Uses placeholders (?) in the SQL query.
➔Prints success or failure messages.

➔ Create a method fetchAllStudents() that:
Fetches and displays all students.

➔ Create a method fetchStudentById(String studentId) that:
Fetches a student by ID.

➔ Create a method updateStudentEmail(String studentId, String newEmail) that:
Updates a student's email.

➔ Create a method deleteStudentById(String studentId) that:
Deletes a student by ID.

UniversityApp Class(Main Class):
--------------------------------
➔Provide a menu-driven(switch case) system using Scanner to allow the user to perform the following operations dynamically:

1.Insert Student objects into the database by calling the insertStudent(Student student) method.

2.Fetch and display all student records by calling the fetchAllStudents() method.

3.Search a student by Student ID by calling the fetchStudentById(String studentId) method.

4.Update a student's email by asking for the Student ID and new Email, then calling updateStudentEmail(String studentId, String newEmail).

5.Delete a student record based on Student ID by calling the deleteStudentById(String studentId) method.

6.Exit the application.

Use a loop (such as while(true)) to continuously show the menu until the user chooses to exit.

Handle user input properly, taking String and integer inputs where needed.

Display appropriate success or failure messages after each operation.
