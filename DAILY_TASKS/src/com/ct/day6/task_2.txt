==================
Write a Java program named CallableStatementRetrievePatient that connects to an Oracle database using JDBC. The program should include the following functionalities:

Establish a connection to the database using the provided JDBC URL, username, and password.

Define a method named callProcedure() that executes a stored procedure named getPatientDetails in the database.
This method should:

Use a CallableStatement to call the procedure.

Pass the patientId as an input parameter to the procedure.

Retrieve patient details such as:

patientName, patientAge, patientDisease

houseNo, city, pincode

email, phoneNo

Display the retrieved patient details on the console.

Implement a main() method that demonstrates the usage of the connect() and callProcedure() methods. The main method should:

Call the connect() method to establish a connection to the database.

Call the callProcedure() method by providing a valid patientId.

Close the CallableStatement and the database connection after executing the procedure call.

Ensure appropriate exception handling for potential database connectivity issues and SQL errors.

Program_03:Write a JDBC application to read the data from CSV file(excel sheet) and insert only even data(Id) into database.
Table:Emp_Info
Columns:Id,firstName,lastName,email,gender.
